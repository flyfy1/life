# life-pomodoro

Pomodoros sit on top of `events` (which carry the time range). The phone, Mac, Windows, and Wear OS apps all create them; this MCP only reads them — starting/stopping a pomodoro is a phone/watch action.

## When to use

- *"how much focused time did I get today / this week"*
- *"show recent pomodoros"*
- *"what was I working on in my last sessions"*

## Tools (MCP `life-on-golang`)

- `pomodoros_list` — date range + optional todo filter; returns aligned `pomodoros` and `events` arrays

## Patterns

**Total focus time.** Sum `event.end_at - event.start_at` for the returned events. There's no pre-aggregated endpoint yet.

**Per-todo.** Pass `todo_uuid` to scope to a single task. Useful for *"how long did the X task actually take"*.

**Read-only for now.** If the user wants to start a pomodoro, tell them to do it from the watch or phone app — there's no `pomodoros_start` tool yet.
